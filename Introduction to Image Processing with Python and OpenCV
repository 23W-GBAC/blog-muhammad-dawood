Python, OpenCV & NumPy

Today, we embark on a thrilling journey into image processing using OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks. I will unravel the secrets behind reading, resizing, blurring, and sharpening images.
## Reading and Displaying Images
With just a few lines of code, we can read and display an image like a work of art. Take a look at this snippet:
# Read an image
image = cv2.imread('bird.jpg')

# Display the original image
cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)

Here, 'bird.jpg' is the path to our majestic avian masterpiece. The cv2.imshow function graciously unveils the image to our eager eyes, and cv2.waitKey(0) patiently awaits our command before moving on.
