# Navigating the Maze of Gym Workouts: My Journey in Building a Workout Plan Reminder

Hey there, fellow students and fitness enthusiasts! Today, I want to share my journey of finding the perfect project for my General Business Administration and Accounting course. Initially, I was drawn to the idea of creating an artificial intelligence model that could analyze chest X-rays to detect COVID-19 infections. Sounds cool, right? Well, it did, until I found myself drowning in complex coding and measures that were way beyond my current skill set.

That's when Som, the health informatics senior, swooped in like a superhero to guide me towards a more feasible project for Professor Dominik Böhler. Confused and unsure, I stumbled upon a problem I faced daily – managing my gym routine.

Being a recent gym joiner, I found myself constantly juggling the question of what workout to do each day. It was a struggle to create a workout plan that made sense for my fitness goals. Thanks to the power of Chat GPT, I discovered a game-changing solution. I simply gave the model a prompt like, "I'm a 25-year-old South Asian Pakistani living in Kasur, weighing 88 kg, and standing at 5 feet 7 inches. What's my BMI, and can you create a monthly workout plan for me?"

Chat GPT not only spat out a personalized workout plan but also gave me insights into the BMI scale, something I was entirely new to. This solution worked wonders for my fitness routine, but a new challenge arose. How do I stay on top of my workout schedule without having to check it every single day?

Enter the idea of a workout plan reminder. Picture this: a progress bar guiding me through each workout, offering instructions, and helping me keep track of the days. I envisioned a tool that not only reminded me of the day's plan but also displayed my progress over time. No more confusion about whether it's leg day or arm day – just a simple reminder to get moving.

As a student navigating the realms of General Business Administration and Accounting, the credibility of my project was crucial. This wasn't just about building a fancy gadget; it was about solving a real-world problem faced by many – the struggle to stay consistent with a fitness routine.

In conclusion, my journey took an unexpected turn from AI and COVID-19 detection to creating a workout plan reminder. Sometimes, the best projects come from personal challenges, and this one aimed to make the gym experience a little less confusing and a lot more motivating. Stay tuned for updates as I document my progress and continue to refine this handy workout companion. Who knows, maybe it'll become a staple for gym-goers everywhere!
