# Making Daily Gym Tasks Google Extension
---------------------------------------------------------

By [Muhammad Dawood](https://github.com/mdawoodaslam)


Hey fellow coders and curious minds! I'm Muhammad Dawood, a student on a quest to conquer the complexities of creating a Chrome extension. Today, I'm excited to take you through the highs, lows, and unexpected turns in my mission to build a task manager for seamless daily gym routines.

## The Spark of an Idea

It all started with a simple notion â€“ wouldn't it be fantastic to have a tool that manages our daily tasks, especially in the realm of fitness? Little did I know, this seemingly straightforward idea would lead me down a rabbit hole of coding challenges and triumphs.

## Laying the Foundation

As any coding journey begins, I set out by adjusting the layout of the Forward, Backward, and Reset buttons. A small tweak in positioning, but oh, the impact it had on the user experience! Forward and Backward dancing in sync, Reset patiently waiting at the end â€“ a layout that just felt right.

However, the initial elation was short-lived. The Forward and Backward buttons decided to throw a tantrum, refusing to cooperate. A debugging marathon ensued, leading me to unravel the mysteries of progress bar glitches. Ah, the joy of overcoming coding hurdles!

## A Touch of Aesthetics

In the quest for visual perfection, I modified the appearance of the navigation buttons. Forward proudly stood tall, Backward humbly stepped down, and the checkbox â€“ well, it discreetly vanished. A small touch, but every pixel counts in the art of coding.

## Into the Extension Universe

Now, the real challenge beckoned â€“ creating a Chrome extension with task management prowess. Tasks were added with a click, and checked off with satisfaction. A virtual task manager was emerging, ready to bring order to the chaos of daily gym routines.

The extension had a mission â€“ to auto-magically incorporate specific tasks related to daily workouts. As the code danced to this rhythm, my Chrome extension evolved into a true fitness companion, effortlessly weaving workout plans into the daily routine.

## The Code Symphony

With the foundation set, it was time to merge my existing code with the new additions. A harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetics, each line of code telling a story of progress and persistence.

## Challenges, Errors, and Icon Woes

However, this journey wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Loading errors haunted me, especially the elusive 'images/icon16.png'. It took some Sherlock-level investigation, but eventually, the icon graced my extension with its presence.

Manifest file issues added to the drama, but hey, coding without a few hiccups is like a rollercoaster without loops â€“ still thrilling, but not as exciting.

## The Daily Gym Reminder 2.0

Inspired by the brilliance of the "Daily Gym Reminder 1.0," I aimed to infuse its qualities into my creation. A nod to excellence, a tip of the hat to an extension that paved the way.

## From Zero to Hero â€“ The Blog Saga

Now, let's talk about the blog. A personal narrative of the struggles, triumphs, and evolution of my project. From the spark of an idea to the rhythmic dance of code snippets, the blog encapsulates the essence of my journey.

## Conclusion

As I conclude this chapter of my coding escapade, I'm not just looking at lines of code on a screen. I see a fitness companion, a virtual task manager, and a testament to the art of problem-solving. It's more than an extension; it's a journey from zero to hero in the coding universe.

Stay tuned for more updates as I fine-tune this gem. Until then, happy coding, and may your extensions be as seamless as your gym routine!

Cheers,
