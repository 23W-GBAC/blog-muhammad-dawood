Title: Navigating the Maze of Gym Workouts: My Journey in Building a Workout Plan Reminder

Hey there, fellow students, and fitness enthusiasts! Today, I want to share my journey of finding the perfect project for my General Business Administration and Accounting course. Initially, I was drawn to the idea of creating an artificial intelligence model that could analyze chest X-rays to detect COVID-19 infections. Sounds cool, right? Well, it did, until I found myself drowning in complex coding and measures that were way beyond my current skill set.

That's when Som, the health informatics senior, swooped in like a superhero to guide me towards a more feasible project for Professor Dominik Böhler. Confused and unsure, I stumbled upon a problem I faced daily – managing my gym routine.

Being a recent gym joiner, I constantly juggled the question of what workout to do each day. Creating a workout plan that made sense for my fitness goals was a struggle. Thanks to the power of Chat GPT, I discovered a game-changing solution. I gave the model a prompt like, "I'm a 25-year-old South Asian Pakistani living in Kasur, weighing 88 kg, and standing at 5 feet 7 inches. What's my BMI, and can you create a monthly workout plan for me?"

Chat GPT not only spat out a personalized workout plan but also gave me insights into the BMI scale, something I was entirely new to. “Sure, I can help you with that. Let's start by calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI). The BMI is a measure of body fat based on your weight your height. The formula for BMI is:

\[ BMI = \frac{{\text{{Weight in kilograms}}}}{{(\text{{Height in meters}})^2}} \]

However, your weight is currently in kilograms and your height is in feet and inches, so we need to convert everything to metric units first.

Your weight in kilograms: \(88 \, \text{kg}\)

Your height in inches: \(5 \, \text{feet} \, 7 \, \text{inches}\)

To convert your height to meters, use the following conversions:
\[ 1 \, \text{foot} = 0.3048 \, \text{m} \]
\[ 1 \, \text{inch} = 0.0254 \, \text{m} \]

So, your height in meters is:
\[ \text{Height} = (5 \times 0.3048) + (7 \times 0.0254) \]

Now, we can calculate your BMI:
\[ BMI = \frac{{88}}{{(\text{Height})^2}} \]

Once we have the BMI, we can interpret it using the BMI scale:

- Below 18.5: Underweight
- 18.5 – 24.9: Normal weight
- 25 – 29.9: Overweight
- 30 and above: Obese

Let's proceed with these calculations and then we can discuss a gym plan and schedule for you.

First, let's convert your height to meters:

\[ \text{Height} = (5 \times 0.3048) + (7 \times 0.0254) \]
\[ \text{Height} = 1.7018 \, \text{m} \]

Now, we can calculate your BMI:

\[ BMI = \frac{{88}}{{(1.7018)^2}} \]
\[ BMI \approx 30.47 \]

Your BMI is approximately 30.47. According to the BMI scale:

- 18.5 – 24.9: Normal weight
- 25 – 29.9: Overweight
- 30 and above: Obese

You fall into the "Obese" category. It's important to note that BMI is a general measure and may not accurately reflect an individual's health, as it doesn't account for muscle mass or distribution of fat. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for a more comprehensive assessment.

Now, let's create a beginner's gym plan and schedule for you. This plan is a general guide, and it's crucial to start slowly, focusing on proper form and gradually increasing intensity. Please consult with a fitness professional or healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program.

**Week 1-2: Establishing a Routine**

*Day 1: Full-body workout*
- Squats: 3 sets of 10 reps
- Push-ups: 3 sets of 10 reps
- Bent-over rows: 3 sets of 10 reps
- Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds each

*Day 2: Cardio (choose one)*
- 30 minutes brisk walking or jogging

*Day 3: Rest or light activity*

*Day 4: Full-body workout*
- Deadlifts: 3 sets of 10 reps
- Dumbbell bench press: 3 sets of 10 reps
- Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg
- Russian twists: 3 sets of 15 reps

*Day 5: Cardio (choose one)*
- 30 minutes cycling or swimming

*Day 6: Rest or light activity*

*Day 7: Rest*

**Week 3-4: Progressing and Adding Intensity**

*Day 1: Full-body workout*
- Increase weights or resistance in each exercise

*Day 2: Cardio (choose one)*
- 30-40 minutes of interval training (alternating between high and low intensity)

*Day 3: Rest or light activity*

*Day 4: Full-body workout*
- Increase weights or resistance in each exercise

*Day 5: Cardio (choose one)*
- 40 minutes of your favourite cardio activity

*Day 6: Rest or light activity*

*Day 7: Rest*

After the first month, we can reassess your progress and adjust the plan accordingly. It's crucial to listen to your body, stay hydrated, and prioritize proper nutrition. Additionally, consider incorporating flexibility exercises and a balanced diet into your routine.

Always consult with a fitness professional or healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual needs and goals.”

But a new challenge arose. How do I stay on top of my workout schedule without having to check it every single day?

Enter the idea of a workout plan reminder. Picture this: a progress bar guiding me through each workout, offering instructions, and helping me keep track of the days. I envisioned a tool that not only reminded me of the day's plan but also displayed my progress over time. No more confusion about whether it's leg day or arm day – just a simple reminder to get moving.

As a student navigating the realms of General Business Administration and Accounting, the credibility of my project was crucial. This wasn't just about building a fancy gadget; it was about solving a real-world problem faced by many – the struggle to stay consistent with a fitness routine.

In conclusion, my journey took an unexpected turn from AI and COVID-19 detection to creating a workout plan reminder. Sometimes, the best projects come from personal challenges, and this one aimed to make the gym experience a little less confusing and a lot more motivating. Stay tuned for updates as I document my progress and continue to refine this handy workout companion. Who knows, maybe it'll become a staple for gym-goers everywhere!
